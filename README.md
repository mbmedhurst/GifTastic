# GifTastic

## How it works:
* Enter the name of an animal into the input field (actually it doesn't have to be an animal - it can be anything)
* Click the 'submit' button or hit the 'enter' key
* A button with the animal name you entered is displayed
* When you click on the button, 10 gifs featuring that animal are displayed on the page
* Clicking on any of the gifs will start the animation, and clicking again will pause the animation


## Special Features
* The input field is cleared when you click 'submit' or hit the 'enter' key
* Blank submissions are ignored
* Duplicate submissions are ignored
